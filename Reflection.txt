In the Half pyramid task the examples using numbers and using alphabet characters uses two different formats.
If the integer input was 3 the pyramid format would be:

1
12
123

and following the same format with the alphabet version a input of eg 'C' would give

A
AB
ABC 

but the actual format in the task example was

A
BB
CCC

Was this intended? The only difference is whether you print the outer or inner for loop parameter.

What did you learn? What did you know already?
So far I already have knowledge of everything we have been doing.

What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?
I didn't find anything particular difficult. One thing I was thinking about was if I was supposed to use
functions or if everything were supposed to be written in the main function (since we are still in a very early state in this course)
but since I did not explicitly say I could not use functions I decided to use it to make the code a bit cleaner.

How can the lab be improved?
I think this was a good first lab.
